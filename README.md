Automatically control Leiningen project version based on Git and system metadata.

## Usage

 1. **Add suitable base tag to repository**
    ```shell
    git tag -a v0.0.0 -m "initial version"
    ```
 2. **Add plugin definition to `project.clj`**
    ```clojure
    (defproject foo "_"  ; replace project version string with underscore
      ...
      ; add the plugin dependency
      :plugins [[fi.polycode/lein-git-revisions "LATEST"]
                ...]
      ; recommended default configuration
      :git-revisions {:format        :semver
                      :adjust        [:env/revision_adjustment :minor]
                      :revision-file "resources/metadata.edn"}
      ...)
    ```

> Project version must be a string for IDE compatability. For example Cursive makes assumptions based on the version
> always being a string.

Further configuration options are described in depth at [git-revisions core library's README](https://github.com/esuomi/git-revisions#configuration).
