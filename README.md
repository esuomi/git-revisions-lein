Automatically control Leiningen project version based on Git and system metadata.

> ## Archival note
> This library is no longer maintained, but remains functional. Its latest published version can be considered feature complete and has proven to be stable. If you need to modify the library in any way, do consider [forking](https://github.com/esuomi/git-revisions-lein/fork).

## Usage

 1. **Add suitable base tag to repository**
    ```shell
    git tag -a v0.0.0 -m "initial version"
    ```
 2. **Add plugin definition to `project.clj`**
    ```clojure
    (defproject foo/bar "_"  ; replace project version string with underscore
      ...
      ; add the plugin dependency
      :plugins [[fi.polycode/lein-git-revisions "LATEST"]
                ...]
      ; add recommended default configuration
      :git-revisions {:format        :semver
                      :adjust        [:env/revision_adjustment :minor]
                      :revision-file "resources/metadata.edn"}
      ...)
    ```

> Project version must be a string for IDE compatability. For example Cursive makes assumptions based on the version
> always being a string.

Further configuration options are described in depth at [git-revisions core library's README](https://github.com/esuomi/git-revisions#configuration).
